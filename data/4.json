We&amp;#39;ve been HAMMERED with snow the past few days, almost week. During this snow storm, the city towed me and the other 5 residents of my building. We had specific parking spaces, but all of us were towed. That was Friday. It will cost me about $700 to get back my stupid car. Saturday, I got in a huge fight with my long distance g/f.  She says she doesn&amp;#39;t want my problems to effect her. Totally understand, but now I&amp;#39;ve lost major support. Sunday my mom texts me the doctor found some cancer in her lymph nodes under her arm. She starts chemo this week. Monday, I&amp;#39;m told my rent will increase by $300 next month, no way I can afford that as rent is too much anyhow, gotta move. Tuesday, yesterday, I find out my boss from summer, who I hit up because I&amp;#39;m in need right now, has 0 intention of paying me anything for my laborious summer work (by my figures, she owes me $7800, but it was clandestine work, so I&amp;#39;m just out (you can look into my post history for deets on that, but I&amp;#39;ll just tell ya; it was growing weed)). Today, I&amp;#39;m told if I have all my stuff packed up from my apartment, and have it move-in ready, my landlord will refund my entire security deposit and prorate Jan rent (good news, right? Nope). I do as told, spend my last $20 on cleaning supplies. He never shows up, so I can&amp;#39;t afford a hotel tonight and I&amp;#39;m back at this empty apt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a bummer! I love life!! I&amp;#39;m low, but I&amp;#39;ve been lower. I&amp;#39;ll get back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left the weed shit to get a real job at everyone&amp;#39;s request. I packed up, moved to Truckee in Northern CA and landed a job as a Ski and Snowboard instructor at Sugar Bowl about a month ago. I taught snowboarding years ago in Utah, so to make myself more a more valuable employee, I learned to teach skiing. And I love it. My bosses tend to give me the younger kids (4-5 year olds have thier own group lessons), I think because we make similar jokes. I make okay money, but with the resort now closed for it&amp;#39;s 5th day, I have had no cash from tips. My paycheck comes on Friday, it&amp;#39;s my first real one, and as I&amp;#39;ve been doing 8-5 everyday until this storm hit, no days off, it should be a healthy paycheck. I&amp;#39;ll be able to get my car back, rent another spot, and most hopefully, fly to Grand Rapids for a few days to give my mom the hug she really fucking needs right now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this shit is pitiful. But I know it&amp;#39;s been worse. Way, way worse for others. I&amp;#39;m still smiling and laughing, but dang I&amp;#39;m hungry. I&amp;#39;d hit the food bank, but even the public transport is closed from this snow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t chain pizza around here if you&amp;#39;re actually willing to pitch in. There&amp;#39;s a place called Best Pies, and it&amp;#39;s pretty great. The number is (530) 582-1111. I have no dietary restrictions, so I&amp;#39;m stoked to try something new. I love spicy, and I truly appreciate a good ol&amp;#39; cheese and pepperoni. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dunno, man. There&amp;#39;s others that could use a pizza, I&amp;#39;m sure. I easily can go with out eating tonight. Maybe if any of you just want to start up a convo, that&amp;#39;ll keep me occupied. Maybe I&amp;#39;m out of line here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This storm will let up. The ski resort will open again, and I&amp;#39;ll be joking and laughing with little snowboard and ski brats soon. My mom will be fine, and my gf is too awesome to stay mad at me for too long.
