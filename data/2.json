I'm dazed and haven't eaten since I got out of the ER and all these ibuprofin and pain pills are starting to tear up my stomach. If someone made a big greasy pepperoni pizza appear at my door or sent me a gift card to get me through the weekend I would be incredibly grateful, and when I get back on my feet (literally) and back to work I will GLADLY pay it forward.\n\n[Proof (nothing graphic except for my dirty fridge)](http://imgur.com/a/DF7kZ)\n\nThank you for reading, and even if you can't send pizza please send good vibes/pray for my recovery. &lt;3\n\n\n*Automod just reminded me to mention that Dominos and Papa Johns deliver to my location.
