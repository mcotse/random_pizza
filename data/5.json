After delivering two other orders in a row, I was on my way to deliver a third. Traffic was insane and the order was already late, so by the time I got to the address the pizza was already over 45 minutes late (as a side note, our company doesn&amp;#39;t have any kind of lateness policy). When the man opened the door he was cheerful and friendly, which I always appreciate. However, he wanted to pay with a $100 bill for a $25 order. As company policy, our drivers are never allowed to carry enough change to break a $100. I told him this, and he desperately scrambled to find other cash around the house. When he failed to do so, he asked if he could follow me in his truck to the nearby 7/11 to see if they could make change. I agreed, and we went on our way. However, we then got caught by a train (as is typical in the area where I live) and had to sit there for another 8 minutes.

I made a split second decision, and I told him that I would pay for his pizza. He was incredibly confused, and he repeatedly told me that he could go somewhere else. I insisted and told him that it wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal. I felt bad for it being so late, for the confusion with the money, for the train, and considering I made considerably more than $25 in tips tonight, I didn&amp;#39;t mind doing it.

As for Christmas I had a small Skype call with my mother and sister, and that was about it. Didn't want to tell them I didn't have anything to eat on Christmas Day since that would break my mom's heart. Either way, I've been sleeping most of the days to stay warm inside my bed and to preserve energy - would love a pizza over the winterbreak.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy holidays.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5kd0ob", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 6, "report_reasons": null, "author": "cheapalternatives", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_5kd0ob", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7wq", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "recipient-1to2", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5kd0ob/request_alone_during_wintertime/?ref=search_posts", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1482773259.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5kd0ob/request_alone_during_wintertime/", "author_flair_text": "Recipient (Got 2)", "quarantine": false, "title": "[Request] Alone during wintertime.", "created_utc": 1482744459.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "num_comments": 1, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 6}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my first Christmas away from home.
