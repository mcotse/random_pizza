Updated rules, sidebar and  ... everything else\n3. New flair systems (automated with bot)\n4. *The Pizza Library* is public! (our new subreddit wiki) \n5. More prominent scam warnings and new [SCAM] tag for scam reports\n\nTurns out, I was more than a little naive in first estimates, in particular the number of time-consuming things that arose once moving to the real subreddit. A lot has happened behind the scenes since the moderator team was expanded about a year ago, culminating in this massive update... Sorry to remove your 3+ years old sticky post, /u/mcredson.. I've been reluctant to do it, thinking you were going for a world record... ;) \n\nIn the new flair system, we have recorded **11000 pizzas received and 8000 pizzas given** (there is no correlation, the system is far from perfect).. But it's 100% safe to say that more than **10000** pizzas have been gifted in total! That is really impressive, with ~40k subscriber, 1 in 4 got a pie! Thanks for participating!\n\n\n**The closed pizza subreddit**\n\n&gt; When /r/RandomActsOfPizza first closed, we expected it to reopen, but that didn't happen. Welcome to all the new users that have subscribed lately. We've counted post history and flairs in both subreddits, plus resurrected an archive of all the (known) posts to our wiki for transparency.\n\n\n**Subreddit Stylesheet**\n\n&gt; A lot of work went into replacing the stylesheet, no better time to learn about an upcoming [Reddit website makeover](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/).. Anyway, we have new RAoP logo, post icons, link flairs, user flairs, etc. Enjoy it while it looks decent! RES Night mode is recommended!\n\n\n**The Pizza Library**\n\n&gt; [The Pizza Library](/r/RAoPCSS/wiki) is now public, as mentioned in PSA before shutdown. It covers many aspects of participating here, and will be linked from automod comments and to answer common questions in modmail. We hope you find it useful.\n\n\n**New Link Flairs**\n\n&gt; /u/GiversBot now controls link flairs to indicate the status/progress of your post (fulfilled, no longer needed, closed, etc). This is all done with a few intuitive commands that work on any reddit client. The bot also sets link flair when gifts are logged using the bot (more below)\n\n\n**New User Flairs**\n\n&gt; Updating the user flair system was a very extensive process, and there are bound to be issues. We will provide opportunity for users to correct their flairs if history is not accurately represented. The new flairs, and the process of arriving at them, [is described in the Pizza Library User Flairs section](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/userflairs). \n\n\n**Bot**\n\n&gt; *  You can use the bot to control link flair (status) of your own posts. Simply comment ``$closed``, ``$reopen``, ``$expired`` etc to set the corresponding flair. \n\n&gt; * **As a giver** you can log gifts by commenting ``$fulfilled with $15 carryout pizza`` *on a [REQUEST] post*, or comment ``$winner /u/username $15 carryout pizza`` in *your own [OFFER]/[CONTEST]*.\n\n&gt; * **As a requester,** you can log a gift by commenting ``$fulfilled by /u/username $15 carryout pizza`` *in your own [REQUEST] post,* or ``$fulfilled by anonymous $15 carryout pizza`` if the donor wishes to remain anonymous\n\n&gt; * The bot publishes profiles of users that submit posts to the subreddit, showing their complete known history. You can manually request a user's profile by doing ``$check /u/username`` (this report can take 10-15 minutes, depending on workload)\n\n&gt; *(replace $value, description and username as appropriate in the examples above)*\n\n\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\n&gt; 1. We now require a **90 days old account** with **400 comment karma**. for requesting (used to be 60/300). The activity limits are better explained in the wiki than ever before.  \n&gt;  * However, in the coming week(s), we will be *lowering* the karma required to *comment.* Instead of having automoderator globally enforce the 400 comment karma limit, we will enforce it with a separate bot *for giveaway posts only.* This will allow lower-karma users to comment on requests without moderator approval (we will review these comments still)\n\n&gt; 2. You are not allowed to post a request or enter giveaways for **90 days** after receiving a pizza, and **7 days** after an unfulfilled request (used to be 14/3).\n\n&gt; 3. Documenting transactions is now a rule (anonymous gifts are possible), as is posting [THANKS] with verification photo when gifted.\n\n(Some other rewording/combining/changes has taken place as well, but those are the major items)\n\n**RAoP By Numbers**\n\n&gt; We used to have approx 9000 users flaired (total), and we recovered approx 2000 from our archive of /r/RandomActsOfPizza.

She lives in a totally normal world, filled with totally normal people all also named Frank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank recently married her high school sweetheart, Frank, and they have a son of their own, named Frank. They all live in their perfectly normal house, with a perfectly normal kitchen...you know like a fridge, freezer, 4 ovens, and 1 burner. Totally normal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now Frank had a large weight placed on her shoulders this year. It was her first Franksgiving festival and she had a family to support! She wanted to go all out and make this an event to remember for her family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day of Franksgiving, Frank realized a drastic emergency! She hadn&amp;#39;t planned well enough on how to cook all of her food! She had her ovens full of the turkey, rolls, green bean casserole, and the traditional frankfurters. She had her burner working on the mashed potatoes. She had her gravy and creamed corn though, without a burner!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a panic, Frank ran to her neighbor Frank&amp;#39;s house begging to use his burner. Frank opened the door to find Frank, on her knees holding a pot of creamed corn begging to warm it up before dinner in a very short time! Now Frank, being a nice neighbor, decided he could wait to finish boiling his frankfurters (like a heathen i might add) so frank could cook her sweet creamed corn! This was a load off of Frank, but there was still the gravy to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now in franks totally normal neighborhood, there were only 2 houses. These belonged to Frank, and Frank. This was normally not a problem, but now was very concerning to Frank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank had heard a story as a child of an old abandoned house in the nearby woods, that used to belong to old man frank, a lonely hermit who was rarely seen. Frank decided it was a good idea to just check out Franks house and see if maybe, there was another burner there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Frank traversed through the woods, she was shocked to hear joyful sounds coming from Franks house. As she got closer, she could see a group of people enjoying their franksgiving meal and conversating jovially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank decided this must be a hallucination, because of the stress of planning her first franksgiving dinner and walked in the house. Immediately, the laughing stopped, and everyone looked at her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who are you to interrupt our hanksgiving celebration?&amp;quot; said the old man at the head of the table&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m frank, your neighbor from down the.....wait did you say &amp;#39;Hanksgiving&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, we are the last of the Hanks. We lived in this world until the Franks moved in and pushed us out, now we live here in the woods&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank was shocked to hear this. All her life she had known of the Franks living here, and was always told it started this way. Frank was also shocked at their kitchen! The kitchen in this house was lacking a number of ovens! and on top of one oven was four whole burners!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir, I am so sorry to hear what happened to your family, and i want to help. Let me cook my gravy on your stove, and then come join us for franksgi..err...hanksgiving celebration?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My family would love to join you&amp;quot; Said the old man Hank&amp;quot; however from this day on, this holiday will be known as frankhanksgiving&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Frank finished her gravy, and joked with the Hanks about the VERY different natures of their kitchens, she realized things might not have always been as she was taught. They all went to Frank, the neighbor, to pick up the creamed corn and headed back to Franks house to celebrate the very first frankhanksgiving with thier families together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This tale was told to us as children, of the melding between the long rivaled Hanks and Franks. All thanks to the woman who was &amp;quot;cookinon3burners&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sorry this is so absurd but i think it works :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Will write a back story for your username if you buy me some dominos or Figaro's! 97351\n\nthanks to /u/cookinon3burners for the hookup! i will update with the story when i get home from work!\n\nSo, our story starts with a girl named Frank.
