They made tacos, apparently, and then threw away what appeared to be 3/4 of the hamburger that they didn't eat. \n\nI didn't say anything at first because my sister holds her friends higher than she does me, and I didn't want to get kicked out, because I had nowhere to go.\n\nBut this pattern continued, and rather than ask if they could eat this or that, they just did, usually after they'd bring home some stranger to have sex with or if the stranger had drugs, etc.\n\nFinally I confronted them, they blew up on me, telling me that they could do whatever they wanted because this was my sister's house, and she'll side with them over anything.\n\nWell, unfortunately, they were right, and I was kicked out. \n\nI had to fake an illness and call an ambulance just to get a ride to a larger city where I'd find a homeless shelter. \n\nHow ironic it was, that the next day I found myself waiting outside in the cold, in line at a soup kitchen, in pursuit of a hot lunch, along with all the other homeless folks around me, while thoughts ran through my head of how my sister and her friends were safe at their home, eating all the food that I bought with my only food stamps but couldn't take with me because I was now homeless and could only carry around clothes with me. \n\nI will not receive any food stamps again until the 13th of next month.\n\nA stranger found out what was going on and decided out of the kindness of her heart to pull me out of the homeless shelter and put me in a motel room, prepaying for two weeks, while I find a job in my \"new\" city. I'm actually pretty optimistic about finding employment now that I'm actually staying in a city much larger than all the little towns I had to stay in over the last seven months or so. I figure the opportunities for employment are much greater here as someone with a stupid felony on my record.\n\nI've got some dress clothes for interviews, some regular clothes, this phone with WiFi here in the motel, my resume (uploaded digitally and I also have physical copies), license (no vehicle), and no money. The motel is a mile or two outside of the city bus limits, and even if I walked to the nearest bus stop, I still couldn't afford to ride the bus to the soup kitchen everyday. So needless to say, I'm hungry.\n\nThanks for listening to my story. I've never posted here before, so I don't know what kind of proof you folks need, but feel free to ask. I also have a Google Wallet account with a linked debit card if anyone is feeling super generous and would like my email. But I don't expect that much. Just to eat for a day would be nice. \n\nSo again, thanks for listening.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5pnxe3", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "flint_mi", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_5pnxe3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7wq", "edited": 1485202204.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "recipient-1to2", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5pnxe3/request_living_in_a_homeless_shelter_now_a_motel/?ref=search_posts", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1485196836.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5pnxe3/request_living_in_a_homeless_shelter_now_a_motel/", "author_flair_text": "Recipient (Got 2)", "quarantine": false, "title": "[Request] Living in a homeless shelter, now a motel, after sister kicked me out for confronting her friends for stealing my only food purchased with the last of my food stamps.", "created_utc": 1485168036.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "num_comments": 8, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/soljakid\"&gt;/u/soljakid&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to respond to my request and make a very shitty week feel so much better.
