I was working in a night club doing glass collecting and had been for 10 weeks and I was being paid cash in hand (What I didn't mind at the time). \n\nThen on the 9th week the place flooded and I got a text a day later saying meet me on the Friday. He then said you haven't been working hard enough and I said I'm sorry I thought I had, I'll try more next week. I found this so odd because, he always praised me for being a hard worker and said I was a great guy. I thought I was doing well.\n\nThe next week I busted my ass off 10-5 and I get another text saying meet me again Friday and he basically said you're being fired and I asked could I get my last pay off you still and said sorry things didn't work out.\n\nI have now text him multiple times asking when can I see him to collect my wages and even tried to go to the club but, refused by him still as his words were \"we haven't got the money yet\".\n\nI learnt today that it was because, of the flooding he let me off as it saved him money and he wasn't going to pay me because, he didn't have too.\n\nBasically, I'm fuming and Pizza would cheer me up as now I'm a student with \u00a350 to his name, rent due and Jobless.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5cg08y", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 25, "report_reasons": null, "author": "RhodesP90", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_5cg08y", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7wq", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "recipient-1to2", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5cg08y/recently_got_fired_from_bar_work_and_they_havent/?ref=search_posts", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1478917467.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5cg08y/recently_got_fired_from_bar_work_and_they_havent/", "author_flair_text": "Recipient (Got 1)", "quarantine": false, "title": "Recently got fired from Bar work and they haven't paid my last shift.
